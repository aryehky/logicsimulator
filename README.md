#LogicSimulator
Welcome to LogicSimulator, an interactive web-based application built with React, designed to simulate digital logic circuits. This project provides an intuitive and educational platform for students, hobbyists, and professionals to design, visualize, and test digital logic circuits in real-time.

##Features

Drag-and-Drop Interface: Easily drag and drop components onto the workspace to build circuits.
Component Library: Includes a rich library of components such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, demultiplexers, and more.
Wire Connections: Intuitive wiring system to connect components, with visual indicators for active signals.
Simulation Control: Play, pause, and step through simulations to observe circuit behavior.
Truth Table Generation: Automatically generate truth tables for the designed circuits.
Error Detection: Identify and highlight design errors or invalid connections.
Save and Load Circuits: Save your circuit designs and load them later for further editing or review.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive application that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
